# Project Name: Easy Wrap
-----------
## Description
<b>What is Easy Wrap?</b>
Easywrap is a full-stack development app the utilizes a plethora of development tools to suggest gifts to its users based on a variety of questions about the gift recipient’s interests as well as providing a price range to provide the most insightful, sincere, and affordable gift for that special someone.

----------

## Motivation
<b>Why did we build this app?</b>
Have you ever wanted to give someone a gift but you want it to be insightful and thoughtful rather than something that comes off as last minute and lazy? You want to get them something that speaks to them and really portrays how much you care. That is the motivation behind easywrap. With a few clicks of a button you can be pointed in the right direction for the perfect gift for that person in a matter of seconds. Net: Grandma can use it.
------------

## Results
<b>How did it turn out?</b>
The current Easy Wrap app achieves functionality and simplicity.
The current Easy Wrap implementation features:
<ul><li>Authenticated Login with Passport</li>
    <li>Get, Put, Read MongoDb functionality</li>
    <li>Dynamic UI</li>
    <li>Node implementation</li></ul>

## Team Efforts
<b>Delegate & Conquer</b>
<i>Easy Wrap was a fully collaborative endeavor.</i>
Together, the team contributed concepts and chose this project for our application. Each team member gave input on names, implementation, data structure, and interface. Marcus Kelly contributed Api implementation and api routing. Jordan McCollam contributed React elements, animations, UI components, and passport authentication. Dick Kimzey and Chase Cannon established schema structure, repo management, and presentation notes.

### Challenges
<b>Overcoming the Unexpected</b>
Managing tasks, commits, and workload always presents a challenge. From a technical standpoint, finding an API that ran at a sufficient speed presented the biggest hurdle. On an inter-personal level — it’s always difficult to coordinate the schedule of four individuals.

## Improvements
<b>What’s Next?</b>
Easy Wrap has a lot of extensability.
A few features we’ve discussed include:
<ul><li>Filtering by budget</li>
    <li>Getting rid of the odd results that comeback</li></ul>
